** Chronic Kidney Disease 
*** Definition
irreversible deterioration of renal function over years, manifested as loss of excretory, metabolic and endocrine function leading to end stage renal disease
*** Stages

**** Stage 1 
- Mild CKD
- kidney damage with normal or high GFR (>90)
- asymp

**** Stage 2
- GFR 60-89
- asymp
[[https://www.victorchengtcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/stages-of-kidney-disease.jpg]]
**** Stage 3A
- GFR 45-59
- Moderate CKD
- Usually asymp

**** Stage 3B
- GFR 30-44
- anemia in some patients
- most are non-progressive

**** Stage 4 
- GFR 15-29
- Severe CKD
- First symp often at GFR < 20
- Electrolyte problems

**** Stage 5
- GFR < 15 or on dialysis
- Kidney failure
- singnificant symptoms and complication usually present
- dialysis initiation usually GFR < 10

*** End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)
Clinical condition where there has been an irreversible loss of endogenous renal function of a degree sufficient to render the patient permanently dependent upon renal replacement therapy to avoid life threatening uremia.

*** Risk Factors 
1. Fam hx of heritable renal disease
2. HTN
3. Diabetes
4. Autoimmune diseases
5. Older age
6. Past episode of ARF
7. Current evidence of kidney damage with normal or even increased GFR

*** Causes? 
1. Diabetic nephropathy
2. HTN nephropathy 
3. Chronic glomerulonephritis
4. Chronic pyelonephritis
5. SLE, PAN
6. Polycystic kidney disease
7. Analgesic nephropathy
8. Multiple myeloma
9. Amyloidosis
10. Obstructive uropathy

*** Investigation
| Initial test                                 | Interpretation                                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Urea and Creatinine                          | \to assess progression                                                              |
| Urinalysis and quantification of proteinuria | \to hematuria and proteinuria indicate glomerular disease and need for renal biopsy |
|                                              | \to proteinuria indicative of progressive CKD                                       |
|                                              |                                                                                   |
1. 
   2. 
   
   
3. Electrolytes
   \to identify hypokalemia and acidosis 
4. Ca^{++} , Phospates, Parathyroid hormone, 25(OH)D
   \to assessment renal osteodystrophy
5. Albumin 
   \to low albumin \to consider malnutrition, inflammation, nephrotic syndrome
6. Full blood count 
   \to if anemic, exclude non-renal causes
