   \to occasional use of Short Acting beta agonist (SABA)
     - for patients with mild intermittent symptoms  
     - Albuterol
     - Pirbuterol
     - Levalbuterol
***** Step II 
   \to SABA + Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS)
     Introduction of regular preventer therapy
     - low dose ICS for initial long term control
     - beclomethasone, budesonide, fluinisonide fluticasone
     - indicated in:
       + has experienced exacerbation of asthma in last 2 years
       + uses beta agonists > 3 times a week
       + reports symp > 3 times a week
       + awakened by asthma one night per week
     - less effective alternates to ICS (chromones, leukotriene receptor antagonist, theophyllines) 
***** Step III 
\to SABA + ICS + LABA
     - if patient remains poorly controlled despite regular use of ICS, consider add on therapy
     - Add LABA such as formetorol, salmeterol
***** Step IV 
\to Addition of fourth drug if poor control on moderate ICS with add on therapy
     - nasal glucocorticoid
     - leukotriene receptor antagonist
     - theophyllines
     - long acting muscarinic agents
     - slow release beta agonists
***** Step V 
\to continuous or frequent use of oral glucocorticoids
     - prednisolone thearpy in the lowest dose possible
     - single dose in the morning
***** step down
     - once under control, dose of oral or inhaled steroid must be titrated to lowest possible dose under which symptoms are under control

***** AP view 
- done in bed ridden pt
- shows ground glass appearance 

**** Thoracocentesis

***** procedure
[[https://i0.wp.com/rnspeak.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/thoracentesis-nursing-responsibilities.jpg]]
- site: mid scapular or posterior axillary line (6-10 cm lateral to spine), and one to two intercostal spaces below the highest level of the effusion.
  
***** findings?
- may suggest empyema or chylothorax by appearance
- blood stained \to malignancy, infarction, traumatic tap
- biochemical analysis \to exudative or transudative

***** light's criteria 
- pleural fluid / serum protein > 0.5
- pleural fluid LDH / serum LDH > 0.6
- pleural fluid > 200 U/L

***** interpretation of light's criteria? 
- pleural fluid is exudative if one or more criteria met 
**** USG 
- most accurate at measure volume of fluid
- can detect as little as 50 mL fluid
- used to guide thoracentesis and pleural biopsy 

**** pleural biopsy  
under guidance of USG/CT, most accurate test for pleural tb 

**** CT 
more sensitive than x ray, distinguishes between benign from malignant pleural disease

*** Management

**** list? 
1. bed rest
2. therapeutic pleural aspiration \to to palliate breathlessness
3. treat underlying cause
4. chest tube insertion
5. pleurodesis \to removal of pleural space in malingnant effusion  
  
**** therapeutic pleural aspiration 

***** indications
1. large effusion upto clavicle
2. cardiac or respiratory difficulties 
3. secondary infection of effusion
4. if effusion doesn't get absorbed spontaneously even after tb treatment 
**** chest tube insertion 

***** procedure 
[[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6b/a5/a0/6ba5a0d3c6355a4763c7c9b8634d294e.jpg]]

***** indications  
1. pleural fluid pH > 7.2
2. pleural fluid LDH > 1000U/L
3. pleural fluid glucose < 50% of plasma glucose
4. +ve gram's stain on culture or empyema
5. rapid reaccumulation 

**** transudative pleural effusion  
- treat underlying cause
- therapeutic pleural aspiration if massive effusion causes dyspnea 

**** tb pleural effusion 
- anti-tb chemotherapy
- prednisolone 40 mg daily orally for 1-2 months if large effusion
  - promotes rapid absorption of fluid
  - obviates the need for further aspiration
  - may prevent fibrosis 

**** parapneumonic effusion  
- uncomplicated \to resolve spontaneously
- complication (frank pus in pleural fluid) \to chest tube drainage 
**** malignant effusion  
- usually reaccumulate rapidly
- drain all fluid via an intercostal tube
-  pleurodesis
*** Complications
