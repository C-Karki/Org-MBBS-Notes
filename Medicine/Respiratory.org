     - low dose ICS for initial long term control
     - beclomethasone, budesonide, fluinisonide fluticasone
     - indicated in:
       + has experienced exacerbation of asthma in last 2 years
       + uses beta agonists > 3 times a week
       + reports symp > 3 times a week
       + awakened by asthma one night per week
     - less effective alternates to ICS (chromones, leukotriene receptor antagonist, theophyllines) 
***** Step III 
\to SABA + ICS + LABA
     - if patient remains poorly controlled despite regular use of ICS, consider add on therapy
     - Add LABA such as formetorol, salmeterol
***** Step IV 
\to Addition of fourth drug if poor control on moderate ICS with add on therapy
